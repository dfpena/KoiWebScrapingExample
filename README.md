### Installing Dependencies

This node requires Pandas. Pandas can be installed using pip in your terminal 

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install lxml
pip install tensorflow
```

if you have python2 and python3 installed

```bash
pip3 install pandas
```

If you are using Anaconda (Pandas is already installed in the default setup):

```bash
conda install pandas
conda install lxml
conda install tensorflow
```
